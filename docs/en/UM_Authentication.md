To maintain the security of your applications and users, all requests to Adobe I/O APIs must be authenticated and authorized using standards such as OAuth and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Before you can access the User Management API, you will need to obtain access credentials by creating a new Integration in the Adobe I/O Console or Admin Console.

## One-time Setup

To obtain the credentials you need to access the User Management service, create a **Service Account Integration** using the [Adobe I/O Console](https://console.adobe.io/).

* A member of the organization with admin rights can create the Integration. You can use the Admin Console to grant administrative privilege to users.
* You will need to create or purchase a digital signing certification, and use it to sign a JSON Web Token (JWT), which you will use to authenticate your requests.
* Your integration provides an API key that uniquely identifies your client, and other credentials that you need to access the UM API.

For complete details of the entire integration process, see [Service Account Authentication](https://www.adobe.io/authentication/auth-methods.html#!AdobeDocs/adobeio-auth/master/JWT/JWT.md).

## Authorizing API calls

To establish a secure service-to-service API session, you will create a JSON Web Token (JWT) that encapsulates your client credentials, and sign the JWT with the private key for a public-key certificate associated with the integration. For complete details, see [Creating a JSON Web Token](https://www.adobe.io/authentication/auth-methods.html#!AdobeDocs/adobeio-auth/master/JWT/JWT.md#creating-a-json-web-token).

You will exchange the JWT for an access token from the Adobe Identity Management Service (IMS). Every request to an Adobe service must include the access token in the **Authorization** HTTP header, along with the API Key (client  ID) that was generated when you created the integration. Include these headers in all requests:

* **Authorization** : A current access token obtained from the login request.
* **x-api-key** : The API key for your integration.  

We recommend that you store your API client credentials and private key with strong protection, but that you do NOT store a JWT or access token. You should create a new JWT for each user-management session, and use it to obtain an access token for that session.

### Log in to gain API access

To initiate each user-management session, create and send a JSON Web Token to Adobe in an access request. Include your JWT in a POST request to the Adobe Identity Management Service (IMS):
```
https://ims-na1.adobelogin.com/ims/exchange/jwt/
```
Pass the signed, base-64 encoded JWT as the value of the URL-encoded **jwt_token** parameter in the body of the POST request.

The response contains an access token that is valid for 24 hours after it is issued. Pass this token in the **Authorization** header in all subsequent requests to the User Management API.

You can request multiple access tokens. Previous tokens are not invalidated when a new one is issued. You can authorize requests with any valid access token. This allows you to overlap access tokens to ensure your integration is always able to connect to Adobe.

* For details of the log-in call, see [JWT Authentication Reference](https://www.adobe.io/authentication/auth-methods.html#!AdobeDocs/adobeio-auth/master/JWT/JWT.md).
* For an example of a script that creates a JWT and makes a log-in call, see [User Management Walkthrough.](samples/index.md)
