Controls whether the `groups` field in the returned user structure contains only those product profiles of which that user is a direct member. If false, returns all groups (user groups, product profiles, and admin groups) containing the user, regardless of whether an entitlement for a particular product profile comes directly (via user assignment) or indirectly (via a user group that contains the user being assigned to the product profile). If true, returns all user groups and admin groups containing the user, but only those product profiles to which the user has been explicitly assigned an entitlement. A user can be both a direct and an indirect member of a product profile. Defaults to `true`.
